Pokemon 

code: ReactJS

The app uses API fetch requests from PokeAPI to show pokemon from different generations. 

This project is done in parallel with my learning at CodeClan during the ReactJS module. 
Every weekend, I aim to add material learnt during the week.

Week 1 - React Structure, Prop Drilling, State, Side Effects, API fetch requests, Event Listeners
Week 2 - Styled Components and Filtered Search  

Includes:

- a nested fetch request
- styled components 
- a select functionality for displaying different generations 
- a toggle shiny on individual pokemon
- filter by type
- search filter that responds to change 
- incorporating .svg icons 

Time Spent: 2 Weekends
